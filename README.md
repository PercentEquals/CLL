## About
  
CLL is my attempt at creating a 'simple' programming language with c-like features.  
It can be used to create scripts or can be embedded into a c++ project.  
  
CLL is [turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness), but it is **not** [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).  
  
## Features
  
* Dynamic variables  
* Multidimensional and irregular arrays (vectors)
* Scoping  
* Flow control  
* Functions  
* User defined functions  
* Recursion  

## Requirements

This solution was created using Visual Studio 2019 with v142 toolset on 10.0.18362.0 Windows SDK.  
CLL uses c++14 features, so it must be compiled with c++14 flag.

## Contributing

Every contribution is welcome, whether it is typo or bug fix or some new feature.  
You can also create example scripts and embedded c++ programs. More info [here](https://github.com/PercentEquals/CLL/tree/master/Examples).
