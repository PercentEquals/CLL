## ABOUT
  
CLL is my attempt at creating a 'simple' programming language with c-like features.  
It can be used to create scripts or can be embedded into a c++ project.  
  
CLL is [turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness), but it is **not** [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).  
  
## Features
  
* Dynamic variables  
* Multidimensional arrays/vectors
* Scoping  
* Flow control  
* Functions
